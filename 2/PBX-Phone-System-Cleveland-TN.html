<p>. Personal branch exchange (PBX) systems are business-grade, private telephone networks. The IP PBX then moves its call to a chosen VoIP-enabled device in your office. Both choices use a range of functions, consisting of auto-attendants, dial-by-name directories, hold music, voicemail, voicemail-to-email, call logging and remote management. Our VoIP solutions use clients the advanced functions and connectivity of a traditional phone line, with the versatility of whatever device they prefer to work such as a smart phone or laptop computer.</p>
<p>VoIP represents voice over internet protocol." VoIP is a digital innovation many organisations are using to take their business communications to next level as they grow their businesses. PBX phone systems are available as Hosted or Virtual solutions (in some cases also called Centrix), and as inhouse solutions to be used on your own hardware. Invented in the 1870s, the telephone passed on calls with the help of a switchboard and an operator.</p>
<p>With a set telephone system, your phone needs to be connected to the network via a cable television. Your business deserves to have the very best phone service possible. DECT (an acronym for Digital Improved Cordless Telecom) is a new standard of interaction procedure and frequency (1920 MHz-1930 MHz, commonly referred to as 1.9 GHz) that was approved by the FCC in 2005 for usage in the United States for Unlicensed Personal Communications Solutions (UPCS).</p>
