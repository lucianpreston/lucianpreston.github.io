<p>VoIP phone service has been around for some time as companies and business owners switch from telephone services that use PSTN (Public Changed Telephone Network) to an advanced system. PBX stands for personal branch exchange, which is an elegant term for a business phone system. Business VoIP phone service has actually been advancing over the previous decade.
