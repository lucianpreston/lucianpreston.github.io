<p>An IP PBX is a VoIP system-- that is, it sends out voice signals over the internet instead of basic phone lines. This means your customers can call one number and speak to anyone in your office. The most obvious and the majority of extensively promoted benefit of VoIP is the ability to conduct a business phone call despite where the receiver is located or whether you remain in the office. Instead of stressing differences that make it possible for significantly targeted and potent messaging, this type of division aims to discover populations of clients who share a concept of what constitutes exceptional service.</p>
